In this project, we'll build a program that helps designers think of new color schemes.

Our program will set the screen's background to a random color. Clicking a button will refresh to a new, random color. Random generators are a well-known tool for breaking a creative rut.

Notice that the <h1></h1>'s text is white if the screen's background is a darker color, but the text is black is the screen's background is a lighter color. Similarly, the <button></button> changes colors based on whether the background is dark or light. Can you figure out how that works?
